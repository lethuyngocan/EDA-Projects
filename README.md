# EDA Projects

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) plays a crucial role in gaining insights, understanding patterns, and discovering key characteristics within the data, ultimately guiding decision-making and driving meaningful outcomes.

Within this repository, I showcase 3 distinct projects that apply EDA techniques to serve diverse business objectives. One project focuses on the retail industry, one caters to the HR department's needs, offering valuable insights for both sectors, and the other leverages the Automatic EDA tools to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the financial performance exhibited by 500 S&P companies

* By employing EDA and leveraging data visualization techniques, I identify and analyze people-related trends, enabling the HR Department to proactively implement effective measures to ensure the smooth and profitable operation of the organization.

* By analyzing approximately 10,000 historical order data from a retail shop, I aim to identify the highest revenue and profit products categorized by product categories and customer segments. Additionally, I will explore the shopping patterns of these segments to gain valuable insights.[Link](https://github.com/lethuyngocan/EDA-Projects/blob/master/super-store-sale-analysis-eda.ipynb)
* Leverage the power of Automatic EDA tools to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the financial performance exhibited by 500 S&P companies.[Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ankumagawa/automatic-eda-with-dataprep-autoviz-profiling)
