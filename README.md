# EDA Projects

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) plays a crucial role in gaining insights, understanding patterns, and discovering key characteristics within the data, ultimately guiding decision-making and driving meaningful outcomes.

Within this repository, I showcase two distinct projects that apply EDA techniques to serve diverse business objectives. One project focuses on the retail industry, while the other caters to the HR department's needs, offering valuable insights for both sectors.

* By employing EDA and leveraging data visualization techniques, I identify and analyze people-related trends, enabling the HR Department to proactively implement effective measures to ensure the smooth and profitable operation of the organization. [Link]()
